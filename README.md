# INTERLOPER FORK

This is a fork of the noclip.website intended for maps related to the zerozerozero project.<br>
Created by qbyte. Modified by programmer1o1. Almost all things should work.

## Compile Guide

This project is a fork of [noclip.website](https://github.com/magcius/noclip.website), and is built using Rust (for WebAssembly) and TypeScript (via pnpm).

### Prerequisites

- [Rustup](https://rustup.rs) (includes Cargo and rustc)
- [wasm-pack](https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-pack/) (though it's not maintained anymore but it should work)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) package manager

> [!NOTE]
> Install instructions vary by platform and are described below.

---

### Windows

1. Install Rust using [Rustup](https://rustup.rs/).
2. Install wasm target:

    ```sh
    rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
    ```

3. Install wasm-pack using `cargo`:

    ```sh
    cargo install wasm-pack
    ```

4. Install Node.js from [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/).
5. Install pnpm globally:

    ```sh
    npm install -g pnpm
    ```

6. Clone the repository and enter the directory:

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/programmer1o1/ZeroZeroZero-MapViewer.git
    cd ZeroZeroZero-MapViewer
    ```

7. Build the Rust code (WebAssembly component):

    ```sh
    cd rust
    wasm-pack build --target web
    cd ..
    ```

8. Install npm dependencies and start the development server:

    ```sh
    pnpm install
    pnpm start
    ```

9. Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.

---

### Linux & macOS

1. Install Rust using [Rustup](https://rustup.rs/):

    ```sh
    curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
    source $HOME/.cargo/env
    ```

2. Add the wasm32-unknown-unknown target:

    ```sh
    rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
    ```

3. Install wasm-pack:

    ```sh
    cargo install wasm-pack
    ```

4. Install Node.js (use your OS package manager or install manually):

    - macOS:

      ```sh
      brew install node
      ```

    - Ubuntu:

      ```sh
      sudo apt update
      sudo apt install nodejs npm
      ```

5. Install pnpm:

    ```sh
    npm install -g pnpm
    ```

6. Clone the repository and navigate into it:

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/programmer1o1/ZeroZeroZero-MapViewer.git
    cd ZeroZeroZero-MapViewer
    ```

7. Build the Rust WASM code:

    ```sh
    cd rust
    wasm-pack build --target web
    cd ..
    ```

8. Install dependencies and run the dev server:

    ```sh
    pnpm install
    pnpm start
    ```

9. Visit `http://localhost:3000` (or whichever address is shown in your terminal).

### Building for Production

To build a production-optimized version of the site:

```sh
pnpm build
```

The output will be placed in the dist/ directory.
